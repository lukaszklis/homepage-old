Last week I took part in [Hack4Culture](http://hack4culture.pl)‚Äìan overnight
hackathon in Wroc≈Çaw. The event was all about *culture*. Sixteen teams have
been working on combining technology with culture on Friday & Saturday.

## Location

[Wroc≈Çaw](http://www.wroclaw.pl/en)‚Äìa lovely city in Poland with plenty of
cultural events and more. I highly recommend visiting it in case when you hadn‚Äôt
had a chance yet. You won‚Äôt regret it. ;) There is only one thing I can advice
against is commuting by car. Unfortunately I decided to do that and ended up
maneuvering in a maze of one way streets in the city center.

The hackathon took place in a Conference Center next to the
[Centennial Hall](http://halastulecia.pl/en/). It‚Äôs a huge structure built in
the beginning of the 20th century.

## Hackathon

The event started around 4pm with a registration. After picking up the starter
kit (a pen, a notebook, a t-shirt, and a power bank), we went towards the
designated for our team desk. One by one, other teams kept showing up, slowly
filling up all of the available spots. Each of the teams was up to 4 people.
In the end, according to what organisers said, around 60 people were eager to
spend the entire night on coding.

Before the hackathon started, [Bartek](https://github.com/B3QL) approached our
desk asking if [Anita](https://twitter.com/anitajaszewska) & me would be up for
merging two, two-persons teams. We‚Äôve happily agreed to that, and after short
presentations from speakers we started discussing what we could do together as
a team.

## The Team

Our team‚Äì‚ÄúCluster of Disaster‚Äù‚Äìhad 4 members:

## The Idea

All of us wanted to build something simple and useful for the users. Despite all
of the previous ideas [Anita](https://twitter.com/anitajaszewska) and me had in
the car on the way to Wroc≈Çaw, we decided to build something different.
Something the entire team wants to create. After a short discussion, we came up
with an idea of [tindart](https://tindart.herokuapp.com/)‚ÄìTinder-alike app for
culture.

The goal of the project was simple: suggest the user which exhibitions she/he
should go to, that match her/his preferences.

How could we do that? The first thing we thought of was defining what kind of
features we want to have as part of a
[MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).

## Defining the MVP

Having a MVP defined
[is important](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product#Purposes).
Not only when it comes to projects built on hackathons, but also in general.
Defining a list of **absolutely necessary** features allows you to **deliver
value on time**. And time is crucial. It helps you **stay focused**, and not
worrying about if you can write all of the code on time, prepare the pitch,
and/or have a power nap in the meantime. You should also keep in mind **it‚Äôs
important to choose the right tools** with which you want, or can work. **On a
hackathon you should make sure to focus on the product development, and not on
building the toolset around it**.

In case of our project, we came up with the following set of **MUST HAVE**
features:

* a simple landing page encouraging the user to explore the product
* sign in/sign up
* ability to rate some of dozens of paintings (if you like it, or not)
* displaying a suggestion to the user with a museum and an exhibition that suits
  the user based on her/his ratings
* matching users with similar preferences

After we knew what to do, we could finally start to work.

## Choosing the Right Tools

When it comes to the choice of technology, we didn‚Äôt want to spend too much time
on finding out if *framework X*, or *language Y* can work for us. We wanted to
pick something with what the most of us has the most of experience.

[Anita](https://twitter.com/anitajaszewska) works as a back-end developer with
Ruby & Ruby on Rails. I work as a front-end developer. The other two
([Daria](https://www.facebook.com/daria.kuczer) &
[Bartek](https://github.com/B3QL)) used to work with many different languages
and technologies during their studies (they‚Äôre both studying Computer Science).
However, both of them were opened for new challenges, and it turned out Ruby
would be a such thing.

We decided to use a simple stack that just works. We picked
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) & [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) for
the back-end (SQLite in the development environment, and PostgreSQL on
  production), [Haml](http://haml-lang.com)/[SCSS](http://sass-lang.com) with
  the support of [BEM](http://bem.info) on the front-end. Everything was
  supposed to be deployed via a simple `git push heroku master` to an instance
  on [Heroku](http://heroku.com). The entire codebase was stored in
  [a repository on GitHub](https://github.com/tindart/tindart).

## Development

Our first *commit* was pushed to the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù branch on Friday at 6:41pm.
[Daria](https://www.facebook.com/daria.kuczer) designed a nice, simple logo,
[Anita](https://twitter.com/anitajaszewska) & [Bartek](https://github.com/B3QL)
focused on preparing models, and I started working on the front-end part.

More time passed, more commits were pushed to *master*. Eventually, around 9pm,
we made a short break to grab a couple of slices of pizza.

All of the teams were working hard on achieving their goals. You could hear
them talking, sometimes even arguing. Somewhere close, you could hear fingers
*clicking* little buttons on the keyboards. You hoped they got mechanical ones,
so they wouldn‚Äôt have to get new ones after this night.

*Tick tock*. *Tick tock*. The clock is ticking.

Our team worked intensively on making sure all of the MVP features are there.
Around 2am I had a small crisis, and I had to take a short power nap to
re-generate my body and mind. Thanks to the organisers for providing poufs
with blankets. They were quite handy. :)

Finally, the morning came. Around 6am almost everything was ready. We only had
to apply some styling to a couple of elements, run some manual tests on
‚Äúproduction‚Äù, and prepare a *pitch*. Up to 5 minutes to present *Who*, *What*,
*Why*, and demo the project in front of everyone. Jury, mentors, organisers,
other teams, and invited guests.

## Pitching the Ideas

As soon as organisers‚Äô watches showed eleven o‚Äôclock, the time has come to
present on what the teams have been working on for the past 20 hours. As
mentioned earlier, **sixteen teams** were supposed to pitch their ideas.
Each of the teams spent around 5 minutes talking what they have built,
which technologies they have used, and demoing the prototypes of the ideas
they had.

Time has come for our team. All of us went on stage.
[Anita](https://twitter.com/anitajaszewska) perfectly pitched our idea to the
crowd, and showed a live demo of [tindart](https://tindart.herokuapp.com/).
**We were lucky**. We picked Heroku as a hosting provider: a free plan, 1 dynos,
18 hours uptime/day. We forgot about the last part‚Äì‚Äú18 hours uptime/day‚Äù. We
set up an account shortly after the first commit without thinking of possible
consequences. **If the demo would be delayed by half an hour, we would not be
able to show the project live**. Of course, we could have still showed the
project locally, but it wouldn‚Äôt be the same.

## Choosing the Best Projects

[The jury](http://hack4culture.pl/#jury) was made of five people with different
backgrounds. Everyone of them rated each of the projects based on the following
criteria: innovation, design, functionality, and the business
potential/usability.

**All of the presented projects were really interesting**. Moreover, all of the
teams were pitching their ideas as they were professionals. **You could see
their pride and passion** about the applications/tools they created.

After all of the pitches ended, the jury gathered to choose the best project of
this year‚Äôs edition of [Hack4Culture](http://hack4culture.pl).

## Rewards

Our team believes hackathons are not to compete with each other and to win
something, but **to have some fun, meet some new, interesting people, and
prove it‚Äôs possible to build a prototype of a product in less than 24 hours**.
Also, to work with technologies you might not be the most familiar with. ;)

In this hackathon, the authors of the best idea according to the jury, could
win a [Microsoft Surface 3](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/devices/surface-3)
tablet (with keyboard) and an
[Apple Watch](http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-sport/42mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-black-sport-band)
(model Sport, black) for each of the team members. Additionally, there was an
additional reward from Microsoft:
a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-3-on-sale/)
for each of the team members. Last, but not least, the audience award: a
[Kindle Touch](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Touch-e-Reader-Touch-Screen-Wi-Fi-Special-Offers/dp/B005890G8Y)
e-reader for each of the team members.

Before the pitches, the organisers decided to split the main reward between two
team in case when they‚Äôll have two teams between which they can‚Äôt choose a
better one.

Really nice rewards to win, aren‚Äôt they?

## The Verdict

After a couple of minutes for the jury, the decision has been made.

The audience award went to the ‚ÄúAllegro‚Äù team for their
["Kubot" project](https://twitter.com/rivadav/status/721261521137963008) (a bot
for Facebook Messenger informing about local cultural events).

The Microsoft award went to the [Mippit team](https://twitter.com/mippit_pl)
for their "Prowizorka" project (a mobile app informing about the street art
events nearby with a possibility to e-donate the performers). Congratulations!
A really nice idea!

**The second place went to our project‚Äì[tindart](https://tindart.herokuapp.com/)!**
All four of us couldn‚Äôt believe what we have just heard. The jury *liked* our
project. The project we have done in less than 24 hours, with a minimal set of
features, with minimal design. Each of us got a brand new Apple Watch Sport
(black coloured) as a reward. As mentioned earlier, no one from our team came
here to win something, but just to have fun. It was a very nice surprise,
nevertheless. ;)

The first place went again, to the ‚ÄúAllegro‚Äù team
([‚ÄúKubot‚Äù project](https://twitter.com/rivadav/status/721261521137963008)).
All of the team members got a brand new Microsoft Surface 3 tablet with an
additional keyboard. I was very happy to see that, *Kubot* was my personal
favourite. I use Facebook Messenger quite often, and I wish to have such a bot
available for public use. Kudos! Well done!

It was a first overnight hackathon I attended. I‚Äôm not quite sure if I should do
it again, since I was struggling a lot with lack of sleep during the night.
Exactly 6 months earlier, together with [Anita](https://twitter.com/anitajaszewska)
I won the third place in a [‚ÄúHack Like a Girl‚Äù](http://hacklikeagirl.co)
hackathon in Berlin with the [Wunschconcert](http://wunschconcert.herokuapp.com)
project.

[Hack4Culture](http://hack4culture.pl) was an event that offered a lot of fun,
new contacts, and personally make me feel closer to the culture & art. I would
like to thank all of the organisers, sponsors, jury, mentors, and participants
for a **really good work** in order to make this event happen. Special thanks to
the beloved *Cluster of Disaster* team:
[Anita](https://twitter.com/anitajaszewska),
[Daria](https://www.facebook.com/daria.kuczer) &
[Bartek](https://github.com/B3QL).
**Our team decided to continue working on the project in the future**. I will
keep you posted. :)

It‚Äôs been a very long, and tiring weekend. Now it‚Äôs time to catch some breath
and rest. ;)
